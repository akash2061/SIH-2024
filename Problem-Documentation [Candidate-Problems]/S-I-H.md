# PROBLEM STATEMENT -1607

## Title : A smart AI based solution for traffic management on routes with heavy traffic from different directions, with real-time monitoring and adaptation of traffic light timings

### AI in Traffic-Management 

* Adjust to varying traffic conditions.
* Traffic planners access to tools that can be used to analyze, detect, and predict patterns in traffic 
* Route optimization to minimize traffic congestion
* Adaptive traffic signals are deployed
* Traffic flow prediction-consolidate the data and use it to understand patterns and trends in traffic flow. 
* Incident detection and management - AI-powered systems can be used to identify and detect traffic incidents such as accidents, wrong-way driver detection, overspeeding, or road blockages
* Environmental Benefits: Decreased waiting times and smoother traffic flow can result in lower fuel consumption and reduced emissions.

#### Machine learning models or algorithms are trained using historical databases to learn and identify patterns between the variables that impact traffic flow. The algorithms are then used to automatically detect and adapt to these patterns, if experienced in real-time. 
	
#### Data Sources used in Predictions A process of predictive analysis is usually the consequence of several sources of data - historical records, weather data, GPS traces from vehicles and mobile devices, and existing information about road networks. 

#### Scope
##### Advanced AI Techniques: Incorporate machine learning algorithms that continuously learn from traffic patterns to improve predictions and control strategies.
##### Integration with Other Systems: Connect with public transportation systems and smart city infrastructure for a more comprehensive traffic management solution.




# PROBLEM STATEMENT -1638

##  Title : AI-Driven Crop Disease Prediction and Management System

* Crop sicknesses represent a critical danger to rural efficiency, prompting yield misfortunes and financial difficulty for ranchers.
* By leveraging AI technologies, such as machine learning and computer vision, researchers and farmers can detect crop diseases early, implement timely interventions, and safeguard crop yields. by the time visual symptoms manifest, the disease may have already spread extensively, making containment and management challenging. 
* By analyzing subtle changes in plant physiology and leaf morphology, AI modelcan identify disease symptoms at their nascent stages, often before they becomvisible to the naked eye. This early detection enables farmers to take proactivmeasures, such as targeted pesticide application or crop rotation, to preventhe further spread of the disease and minimize yield losses.

### Solution - Machine Learning and AI in Crop Disease Detection 
1. Using Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
2. Using ViT Models 
3. Using Generative AI 

#### Impact and Benefits:
* Early Detection: Enables early identification of crop diseases, allowing farmers to take timely action to prevent widespread outbreaks.
* Informed Decisions: Provides farmers with data-driven insights and recommendations, improving decision-making and management practices.
* Increased Yields: By effectively managing diseases, farmers can potentially increase crop yields and reduce losses.
* Cost Savings: Early intervention and precise recommendations can lead to cost savings in terms of both treatment and crop loss prevention.
