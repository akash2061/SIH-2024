# PROBLEM STATEMENT -1607

## Title : A smart AI based solution for traffic management on routes with heavy traffic from different directions, with real-time monitoring and adaptation of traffic light timings

### AI in Traffic-Management 

1. Adjust to varying traffic conditions.
2. Traffic planners access to tools that can be used to analyze, detect, and predict patterns in traffic 
3. Route optimization to minimize traffic congestion
4. Adaptive traffic signals are deployed
5. Traffic flow prediction-consolidate the data and use it to understand patterns and trends in traffic flow. 
6. Incident detection and management - AI-powered systems can be used to identify and detect traffic incidents such as accidents, wrong-way driver detection, overspeeding, or road blockages
7. Environmental Benefits: Decreased waiting times and smoother traffic flow can result in lower fuel consumption and reduced emissions.

#### Machine learning models or algorithms are trained using historical databases to learn and identify patterns between the variables that impact traffic flow. The algorithms are then used to automatically detect and adapt to these patterns, if experienced in real-time. 
	
#### Data Sources used in Predictions A process of predictive analysis is usually the consequence of several sources of data - historical records, weather data, GPS traces from vehicles and mobile devices, and existing information about road networks.
